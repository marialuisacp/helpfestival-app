Develoment of Help Festival 2017 App.

In 2017 a friend invited me to create a mobile app for a festival that he has organizer. I had a week to create this app.

Dowload this app:
- [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ionicframework.helpfestival895626)
- [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/help-festival/id1286950329?l=pt&ls=1&mt=8)

I developed an informative application for a Christian festival that takes place in Campo Mour√£o, the Help Festival.

The purpose of the event is to bring speakers, workshops on weekend missions, as well as bands and artists.

The application was developed for Android and iOS devices with the purpose of bringing information about the event such as location, schedule, speakers, map, contact form and event evaluation. The app is available in stores.

I used Ionic 1 because of short time to develop.
